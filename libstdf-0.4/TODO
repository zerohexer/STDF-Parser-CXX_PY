0.5:

 - polish writing support

 - publish a cleaned up spec file containing all the info i have for
   STDFv[34] in html format and post to website

 - clean up the custom STDF files i wrote and post to website along with
   the output generated when run through the example apps

unknown:

 - read in data from the STDF files in larger chunks than just 1 record at 
   a time ... since files can easily have 50000+ records, we could cut the 
   # of filesystem reads down by more than a factor of 10 with buffers of 
   512/1024/etc... bytes

 - STDF 'lint' remover to 'shrink' STDF files ...
   - check if PTR records repeat the entries for limits, test name, etc...
     If so, then remove duplicate entries after the first occurence
